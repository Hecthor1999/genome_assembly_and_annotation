Genome assembly and annotation

This repository contains all the necessary scripts to produce three different genome assemblies and one transcriptome assemlby
The goal of these scripts is to study the genomic differences between worldwide Arabidopsis thaliana samples.
To achieve this, The genome of the specific sample with accession name Altai5 is assembled with three tools for comparison to produce the best possible assembly as well as create a transcriptome assembly.
The best Assembly will the be used to do genome annotation.
